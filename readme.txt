Through this graph we take a look at the variation in field accessibility across the different types of fields recorded. Each bar represents the absolute deviation
from a 50% split of in-field and out-of-field points. Unsurprisingly, the most deviation came from the "Home garden or irregular" category. "One crop" and "Multiple crops" showed small a small amount of deviation, with "One crop" surprisingly having a higher percentage of points recorded from inside the field. "Fallow" showed similar proportions
to the other categories ("aside from "Home garden or irregulear""), however it is noteworthy that this is the only category with more than half of the points taken from outside the field. With this scale of data, it is hard to determine whether this is significant or not, however it could be the case that most "Fallow" areas are at the edge of farms, and thus outside the reaches of out data team to go to collect. Overall though, it seems that the split is about 50/50 between in-field and out-of-field points (aside from "Home garden or irregulear").
